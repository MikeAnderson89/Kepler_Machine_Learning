# MACHINE LEARNING FOR KEPLER OBJECTS

### Models Used
#### K-Nearest Neighbors
#### Random Forest
#### Support Vector Model

### The best variables to use were determined by running a correlation analysis on the dataset and testing the models based on varied parameters.

### The overall accuracy of the models was ~80%, up from 65% if all of the variables in the dataset were used.  The reason for the disparity is due to over-fitting of the model to the training set, making it inapplicable to unknown data.
